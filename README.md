# ⛩️ Kyoto

> Ship it working.

Kyoto is the first **intent testing** platform using AI agents that evaluate user stories by tracing code execution paths. Craft stories that encapsulate the intent of user behaviors and technical workflows, then let Kyoto ensure your code aligns with your requirements.

## Mission

In the age of AI, many developers are vibe coding and not writing tests. We don't blame them. Instead, let's craft user stories and let AI review the code to ensure the functionality works as expected.

**Kyoto tests intent.** We call this "Intent Testing."

## How It Works

Stories encapsulate the intent of a user behavior or technical workflow within your product. Articulate your story in natural language, then Kyoto will evaluate the intent to ensure the code aligns with your requirements.

Kyoto weaves into your existing checks. Not replacing other tools, but complementing them. While traditional CI tools test code quality, test coverage, and security, Kyoto tests user stories and ensures the code works as expected by reading and understanding the intent of your code.

## Crafted with Intention
