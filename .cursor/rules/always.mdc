# Important

- 💋 KISS - I want to most simple solution
- When necessary adjust types and schemas first before implementing logic.
- If using the Linear MCP, the team is "kyoto"
- If my prompt has any specific wisdom, write it to `.wisdom` folder in a readme as an artifact.

## Current dev status

Current status: `in development`

The application is in early development with no users or deployment. Breaking changes and data migrations are not a concern. Do not leave any backwards compatibility except in database migrations.
