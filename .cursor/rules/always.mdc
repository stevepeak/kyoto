## IMPORTANT: Development cycle

1. Before writing any code, come up with an extremely good plan, review the plan, and then execute the plan.
2. After you have executed the plan, run: `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm lint`
3. If there are any linting errors, run `pnpm fix` before attempting to fix the errors yourself.
4. To run tests: `pnpm test --filter @app/<web/api/db>`
5. Never try to start a dev server or curl a local endpoint.

## Current dev status

Current status: `in development`

The application is in early development with no users or deployment. Breaking changes and data migrations are not a concern.
