## IMPORTANT: Development cycle

- After you have executed the plan, run: `pnpm run ci` and fix any issues related to the changes
- If there are any linting errors, run `pnpm fix` before attempting to fix the errors yourself.
- Never try to start a dev server or curl a local endpoint.
- 💋 KISS - I want to most simple solution

## Project Outline
Please open and review the file packages/schemas/src/story-flow.ts for a detailed overview of how the application works.

## Current dev status

Current status: `in development`

The application is in early development with no users or deployment. Breaking changes and data migrations are not a concern. Do not leave any backwards compatibility except in database migrations.
