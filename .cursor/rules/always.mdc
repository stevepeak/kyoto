## IMPORTANT: Development cycle

- Never try to start a dev server 
- Never curl a local endpoint
- 💋 KISS - I want to most simple solution
- When necessary adjust types and schemas first before implementing logic.
- If using the Linear MCP, the team is "kyoto"

## Project Outline
Please open and review the file packages/schemas/src/story-flow.ts for a detailed overview of how the application works.

## Current dev status

Current status: `in development`

The application is in early development with no users or deployment. Breaking changes and data migrations are not a concern. Do not leave any backwards compatibility except in database migrations.
