# Important

- 💋 KISS - I want to most simple solution
- When necessary adjust types and schemas first before implementing logic.
- If using the Linear MCP, the team is "kyoto"
- If my prompt has any specific wisdom, write it to `.wisdom` folder in a readme as an artifact.
- use package.json workspaces catalog for installing new dependancies
- Always use ESM `import` and `export` (never use CJS `require`)
  - File imports should end with `.js` (NOT `.ts` or `.tsx`). Module or subpath imports don't need the extension.
- Do not change `tsconfig.json`, ask permission with explaination if necessary
- used named arguments `(args: {foo: string})` over inline arguments `(foo: string)`
- never make changes to ./components/ui files

## Current dev status

Current status: `in development`

The application is in early development with no users or deployment. Breaking changes and data migrations are not a concern. Do not leave any backwards compatibility except in database migrations.
