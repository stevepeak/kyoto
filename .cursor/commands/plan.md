Please go through each of the Linear issues in `kyoto` team that are in the `Todo` state that **do not have an issue estimate yet** 

**Evaluate** the ticket by reviewing the code to come up with a plan for each of the story
**Then** update each linear ticket's description with that plan
**And** update the issue estimation to fibonacci sequence based on the complexity

### How to determine complexity?
Assign 1 point for each package or system that requires being touched. For example:
- migrate the database
- create a new packages/
- adjust backend
- adjust frontend
