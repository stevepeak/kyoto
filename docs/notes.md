# Will

- command for running against your staged/unstaged
- vibe check everyting since branch off main, because each commit doesnt tell the whole story collectively
- store the stories as checked in artifacts. use hash

# Cole

- kyoto puts github comments w/ new/changed/removed stories
- rrweb (sentry fork of rrweb is open source)
- Kyoto will eventurally replace Linear/Jira/etc. because it has
  real recordings, annotation of code, and directly related
  to user facing functionality.

# Notes

- save browser recordings
- vscode extension for viewing tests
  - and vibe checks
- 1 headless per agent
- `kyoto vibe prompt`
  - what do you want to build
  - gather context
  - what do i need
- `kyoto vibe check --all` for looking over entire code base

---- Focus on kyoto MCP because Swatantra
