# Will

- command for running against your staged/unstaged
- vibe check everyting since branch off main, because each commit doesnt tell the whole story collectively
- store the stories as checked in artifacts. use hash

# Cole

- kyoto puts github comments w/ new/changed/removed stories
- rrweb (sentry fork of rrweb is open source)
- Kyoto will eventurally replace Linear/Jira/etc. because it has
  real recordings, annotation of code, and directly related
  to user facing functionality.
