> _**Vibe coding comes with risks.**_ Entropy can quickly creep into your codebase bringing you

Kyoto vibe checks your AI code to reduce entropy and optimize your AI vibing experience.

```sh
kyoto vibe check
```

or, choose what to vibe check with

```sh
kyoto vibe check               # all uncommited changes
kyoto vibe check --last        # since last vibe check
kyoto vibe check -1            # last commit
kyoto vibe check -3            # last 3 commits
kyoto vibe check --since main  # branch changes
kyoto vibe check --staged      # staged changes only
kyoto vibe check --unstaged    # unstaged changes only
```

or, let coding agents vibe check themselves

<Note>Set up the [Kyoto MCP](/pages/integrations/mcp)</Note>
