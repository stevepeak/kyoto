_**Vibe coding comes with risks.**_ Entropy can quickly creep into your codebase bringing you
development flow to a grinding halt. Generated code can have security issues, bugs, dead code, and
duplicate functions - not good vibes. Kyoto vibe checks your code to ensure it remains
in good shape to promote your rapid development.

```sh
kyoto vibe check
```

or, let coding agents vibe check themselves
