> Automated browser testing after new vibe-coded changes/features.

Kyoto explores the code changes to see what frontend features were added or changed
then runs a series of tests to check if they work.

```sh
kyoto vibe test
```

This command will review all uncommited changes for tests to run.

or, let coding agents vibe test themselves

<Note>Set up the [Kyoto MCP](/pages/integrations/mcp)</Note>

## Options

#### Scope

Change the scope that Kyoto will evaluate.

```sh
# Default
