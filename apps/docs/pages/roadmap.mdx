description: What we’re building next in Kyoto

Two upcoming features, focused on **product truth** and **automatic validation**.

<Card title="User behavior wiki">
  **Deep Wiki but for User Behaviors** for your product to have a clear
  understanding of what your product _does_ (flows, screens, states)
</Card>
<Card title="Browser automation">
  Kyoto AI runs end-to-end flows in a real browser - Produces evidence
  (screenshots/logs) when something breaks - Can be driven by the behavior wiki
  for coverage
</Card>
