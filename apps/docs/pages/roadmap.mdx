Kyoto is crafted to help you keep your codebase coherent while you move fast with AI.
Today, `vibe check` focuses on testing and diffing user stories against your changes.
Next, we’re expanding Kyoto beyond “code quality” into **product understanding** and
**automated validation**.

<Info>
  Kyoto is **free** with special thanks to `x-ai/grok-4.1-fast` via
  [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/).

## Roadmap

Two upcoming features, focused on **product truth** and **automatic validation**.

<details>
  <summary><strong>User behavior wiki</strong></summary>
  <br />

- Catalog of what your application _does_ (flows, screens, states)
- Generated from your repo + kept up-to-date as you change code
- Used as the source of truth for reviews and tests

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Browser automation</strong></summary>
  <br />

- Kyoto AI runs end-to-end flows in a real browser
- Produces evidence (screenshots/logs) when something breaks
- Can be driven by the behavior wiki for coverage

</details>

## Want to influence the roadmap?

If you have an app/workflow where a **behavior wiki** or **browser automation** would be
especially valuable, open an issue with:

- the app type (SaaS, marketplace, internal tool, etc.)
- your core user flows
- what “regression” usually looks like for you
