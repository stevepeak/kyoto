We are crafting **Kyoto** to be the missing vibe coding tool. Today, we offer
the `vibe check` tool that runs several agents focused on fixing ai generated slop
and prevent entropy in your code base so you can remain productive
with vibe coding.

<Info>
  Kyoto is **free** with special thanks to `x-ai/grok-4.1-fast` via
  [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/).
