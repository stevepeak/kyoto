We are crafting **Kyoto** to be the missing vibe coding tool. Today, we offer
the `vibe check` tool that runs several agents focused on fixing AI-generated slop
and preventing entropy in your codebase so you can remain productive with vibe coding.

<Info>
  Kyoto comes with **$5/month** of free llm credits. [Contact
  us](https://x.com/iopeak) if you exceed that limit.
