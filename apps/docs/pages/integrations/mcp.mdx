## Tools

Kyoto MCP provides the following tools for code review and quality checking:

### `code-review`

Run all code review agents on unstaged changes. This comprehensive tool executes all individual agents in parallel and returns a combined summary of findings.

### Individual Agent Tools

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="bug-detection" icon="bug">
  Detect bugs, logic errors, and potential runtime issues within the scope
</Card>

<Card title="code-organization" icon="folder">
  Find functions and components that should be moved to other packages or
  extracted into helper functions to reduce file sizes
</Card>

<Card title="function-consolidation" icon="merge">
  Highlight opportunities to merge or extract shared helpers from similar
  functions
</Card>

<Card title="library-usage" icon="book">
  Check library usage against documentation to ensure best practices and avoid
  reinventing the wheel
</Card>

<Card title="secret-detection" icon="key">
  Scan code changes for leaked secrets, API keys, passwords, and other sensitive
  information
</Card>

<Card title="stale-code-detection" icon="trash">
  Detect unused code that was added in scope or became unreachable due to
  changes
</Card>

<Card title="browser-test" icon="browser">
  Run browser tests on code changes using an AI agent. Analyzes changes, generates
  test suggestions, and executes them automatically
</Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  Use the `code-review` tool to run all checks at once, or call individual agent
  tools for specific analysis. All tools analyze unstaged changes by default.
