## Automatic Setup

<Tip>Use the Kyoto CLI to automatically set this up</Tip>

```sh
kyoto setup mcp
```

Follow the instructions to configure the MCP service which includes:

- Adding Kyoto to `.cursor/mcp.json`
- Creating a `.cursor/rules/kyoto.mdc` for agents to follow

## Manual Setup

First, register the MCP service, then give instructions to your agents to use it.

**Register Kyoto's MCP**

<CodeGroup>

```json .cursor/mcp.json
{
  "services": {
    "Kyoto": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["kyoto", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

**Add agent rules**

<CodeGroup>

```md .cursor/rules/kyoto.mdc
