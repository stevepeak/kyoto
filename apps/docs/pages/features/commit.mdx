description: Break apart larger code changes into smaller, well-documented commits.

When we vibe, we can tend to make many changes across the codebase.
It becomes difficult to manage what files in what order should be committed.
Use Kyoto to commit changes sequentially and with AI-summarized messages.

## Plan commits

To generate a commit plan without committing, use `--plan`.

```sh
kyoto commit --plan
```

and, you can guide the plan

```sh
kyoto commit --plan "new button and bug fix"
```

Like what you see? Have Kyoto make those commits for you.

## Make commits

When ready (or yolo!), you can have Kyoto commit the changes you have made sequentially.

```sh
kyoto commit
```
