Summary:

The developer is integrating GitHub Checks API support into CLI agents for bug detection, code organization, function consolidation,
secret detection, and stale code detection to enable inline annotations and check runs in GitHub Actions. Key changes include adding
GitHub context (owner/repo/sha/token) to agent options and VibeCheck, implementing `createGitHubChecksTool` for creating check runs,
updating agent prompts to use it, and adding GitHub env detection. A new 'diff' CLI command is also added to analyze staged/unstaged git
changes, enhancing CI/CD feedback in PRs.
